# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Instructions to Run the Project

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-task-manager.git
   cd react-task-manager
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the Development Server:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Open in Browser:**

   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`.

## Overview of Implemented Features

1. **User Authentication:**

   - Users can sign in using a simple username.
   - Authentication state is managed using React context and local storage.

2. **Task Management:**

   - Users can create, edit, and delete tasks.
   - Tasks are stored in local storage and retrieved upon loading the application.
   - Each task includes a title, category, due date, and tags.

3. **Responsive Design:**
   - The application is fully responsive and adapts to various screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).

## Challenges Faced and Solutions Implemented

1. **Challenge: Managing Authentication State**

   - **Solution:** Implemented React context to manage authentication state and persisted the state using local storage.

2. **Challenge: Handling Task Storage**

   - **Solution:** Used local storage to store tasks and implemented functions to create, update, and delete tasks.

3. **Challenge: Ensuring Responsive Design**
   - **Solution:** Used CSS media queries and responsive design techniques to ensure the application adapts to different screen sizes.

## Deployment URL

A live version of the application is hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), or [Firebase Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/products/hosting).

**Deployment URL:** [https://your-app-url.vercel.app](https://your-app-url.vercel.app)
